# Crop-Yield Prediction in NewZealand Using Machine Learning

Introduction:
The project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict crop yields in New Zealand, leveraging various factors such as weather patterns, soil characteristics, and agricultural practices. The focus is on three major crops: wheat, barley, and maize, with data spanning from 2019 to 2023 across all regions in New Zealand.

Objectives:
Data Collection and Integration and creation of machine learning model to predict the future yield

Collect data from multiple sources.
Combine these datasets into a single comprehensive dataset.
Data Visualization:

Apply visualization techniques to highlight key patterns and trends in the data.
Model Development:

Implement various machine learning techniques, including regression, classification, and clustering, to predict crop yields.

Data Considerations:
Weather Characteristics: Monthly data for total rainfall, number of wet days, mean air temperature, total sunshine hours, and mean wind speed.
Agricultural Practices: Annual fertilizer application data for each region.
Soil Characteristics: Land use, soil types, available mineral nutrients (AMN), bulk density, total carbon content (TotalC), total nitrogen content (TotalN), and minimum/maximum target values.

Methodology:
Data Preparation:
Gather data for different regions over five years.
Integrate weather, soil, and agricultural practice data.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Use visualization tools to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

Model Application:
Test different machine learning models to find the best predictors for crop yields.
Compare the performance of regression, classification, and clustering models.

Outcomes:
The project successfully integrated diverse datasets and applied various machine learning techniques to predict crop yields. The visualization of data provided clear insights into the factors influencing crop yields, and the models developed offer a robust tool for forecasting future yields based on historical data.

This comprehensive approach not only aids in yield prediction but also helps in understanding the underlying factors that affect agricultural productivity, providing valuable insights for farmers and policymakers in New Zealand.
